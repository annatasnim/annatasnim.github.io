	<h4> As awlways, the day started with the instructer having problem with the projector. <br> Today we worked on something very intereting. Our task was to find clues regarding Ariana Venti's missing case. <br> From the 'backstage' of Ariana's concert, that our instructers kindly created, we found an encrypted message. ALong with that, we found hidden beads in slime that would tell us what the key was. <br> So, first we had to put together the beads, which said "The key is in your hand." So, we knew the key was "slime." Then, knowing it was Vigenere cipher, we used the key and decrypted the message. The messege was the following: "Hey Beyond-C, I have a message for you, but I must tell you in secret. Can you please get on my laptop and do the ykw?" We are gussing the 'ykw' stands for 'you know what?' <br> Concluding this case, we have no idea where Ariana Venti is currently. <br> Lunch is coming up soon. I hope it's not too hot outside. </h4>
